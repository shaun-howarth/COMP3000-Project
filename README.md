# COMP-3000 Final Year Computing Project

## Taskacard

This repository contains the source code and assets for the COMP3000 final year university software project. This was an individual piece of work that was carried out with the modulem being worth 40 credits for the final year.

## Project Vision:

Taskacard is a cross-platform application that is an android mobile app and web interface that acts as a Kanban task making tool. The aim of this project is to create a list making application whereby users can create multiple virtual project boards. Each project board will then have a Kanban layout approach that will allow the user to create task cards that are used for planning out tasks in a to-do list format. Taskacard will provide users with a portable platform to list out tasks whether this be relating to a work project or normal day to day life. Plain text, deadline dates and possible file attachments such as images will be included within a task card, thus also providing full CRUD functionality based on the modification of data. Similar existing kanban solutions are often proprietary, so developers canâ€™t contribute to the software and add useful functionality. By making an open-source alternative, developers can add features that would be useful.
