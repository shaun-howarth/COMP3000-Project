## Taskacard

This repository contains the source code and assets for the final year university independent software project.

## Project Vision:

Taskacard is a cross-platform application that is an android mobile app and web interface that acts as a Kanban task making tool. The aim of this project is to create a list making application whereby users can create multiple virtual project boards. Each project board will then have a Kanban layout approach that will allow the user to create task cards that are used for planning out tasks in a to-do list format. Taskacard will provide users with a portable platform to list out tasks whether this be relating to a work project or normal day to day life. Plain text, deadline dates and possible file attachments such as images will be included within a task card, thus also providing full CRUD functionality based on the modification of data. Similar existing kanban solutions are often proprietary, so developers canâ€™t contribute to the software and add useful functionality. By making an open-source alternative, developers can add features that would be useful.



## Allocated lecturer as project supervisor:
